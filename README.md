# CS-255-System-Analysis-Design

#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for the DriverPass project was a company called DriverPass lead by Liam as the owner. The goal of this system was to enable DriverPass to offer online practice tests and provide learning materials for students who were preparing for their driving test. In addition to practice tests, this system was supposed to organize and schedule driving lessons with a driving instructor for students. 

#### What did you do particularly well?
I think the parts that I did a particularly good job for this system were the requirements for the system and the UML class diagram. These two areas felt the most complete and thought through. 

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to pick one part of the work for these documents to revise, it would be the nonfunctional requirements in the business requirements documents. I felt that I needed to provide some more solid and less general requirements that relate more directly to the system i was describing. If i were to do this again I would focus more on quality over quantity and work through all of the various needs of the system. 

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I looked through the entire interview transcript that I was given and as I went through it I took notes on the various key things that Liam (the owner) said were a big part of the system. I also looked at the UI design that was provided in the transcript and made note of the major elements that were shown. From there I approached the design as if I were the user and wrote down all the steps I would need to take to complete each of the required actions that were described. In designing a system it is imperative that the end-user's needs are considered since they determine how the system is used. If the programmer decides that something should be done a certain way or by following a certain path of steps and the end user decides that that approach is too aggravating then they will chose to not use that feature or look for a different system that will meet their needs better.

#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In designing software on my own I first look at what the general idea for what i'm creating is and then I look at why someone would find that useful/interesting. From there I go on and write down some firm ideas about what exactly I want this software to do. After this I create a basic mockup on paper of the design and features and show them to my friends and family to see if they have any suggestions as to changes or improvements. In the future I plan on using UML diagrams more so that I can better communicate the design of the features to the people around me.
